# Spring-6-Course
Hey there! I’m enrolling in a course on ‘Spring Boot 3,’ where I’ll delve into Spring 6, Spring Core, Spring REST, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, JPA, Hibernate, and MySQL. My plan is to upload the exercises along with some additional explanations directly into the source code.
